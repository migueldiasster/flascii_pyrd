============

There has been a lot of buzz about [Flappy
Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) in the past few days.

I'm not big on games or anything, but I couldn't resist the temptation and put
together this terminal-based tribute as a weekend project... and I won't take
it down ;)

Enjoy!
